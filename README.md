## Challenges During this Project

My original idea had the usage of sockets for instant messaging, video calling, and real-time notifications. Sadly there were time constraits and these things had to be removed.

I decided to build a backend application with Node, Mongoose, and Express, which you can view [here]().


--------------------------------------------
## Future Plans for IKnowJS:

* Integrating with Nodes file sharing, input/output, and streaming packages.
* Using some sort of socket software for.
* Connecting to a bucket like S3 for video, photo, and file saving.
* Building a UI for live coding sessions.
